        <p>My name is Jaelyn McLaurin, age 17, in the 12th grade. I am apart of the Computer Science Principles class that is at my school, with an amazing teacher.</p> 
        <p>The main reason for my interest in Computer Science is because I plan to major in it when I go to college and hopefully pursue my career in it when I'm older.</p>
        <p>I'm an honor roll student for 3 years staright and plan to continue my good streak when I head to college. </p>
