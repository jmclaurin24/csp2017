  <p style="font-family:verdana;"> My name is Jaelyn McLaurin, age 17, and I am currently enrolled at Gahr Hgh School. Last year, I had the experience </br>
  <p style="font-family:verdana;">to be a part of Intro to Computer Science class that was being held at my school.</br>
  <p style="font-family:verdana;"> Overall I had a stupendous time which made me advance my learning to take the AP Computer Science class this year.</br>
  <p style="font-family:verdana;"> As  advance my knowledge, I plan to continue taking computer science in college as my intended major. </p>
