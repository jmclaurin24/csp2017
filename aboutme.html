        <p>My name is Jaelyn McLaurin, age 17, in the 12th grade. I am apart of the Computer Science Principles class that is held at my school, with an amazing teacher.</p> 
        <p>The main reason for my interest in Computer Science is because I plan to major in it when I go to college and hopefully pursue my career in it when I'm older.</p>
        <p>I'm an honor roll student for 3 years staright and plan to continue my good streak when I head to college. Coding is not the only hobbie I do however. In my free time </p>
        <p>I love to hang out with friends, listen to music, and what every other teenager loves to do as well which is sleep.</p>
      <b>Experience In Computer Science</b>
        <p>I did not have an interest in computer science until my sophomore year in high school. My older sister majored in it and inspired me to "take a whack at it" as </p>
        <p>she would say, and maybe I'd like it. Thankfully, my school was starting to add different classes to our school and Intro to Computer Science was one of them.</p>
        <p>At first, I was confused and did not know what I was doing in the class, but with the help of my teacher I got the hang of coding and enrolled in AP Computer Science</p>
        <p>for the upcoming year as quick as I could.</p>
      <b>Family</b>
        <p>I live at home with my mom and dad whee I'm considered an only child because my older sister moved out about fve years ago to attend college in Maryland</p>
        <p>and sarted work right out of colege, causing her to move to Texas and work for Microsoft. I have three pets, two dogs and one turtle, who I also consider to be</p>
        <p>a huge part of my family.</p>
